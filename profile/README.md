# PUBG Wallhack 🔥 X-Ray Vision for Total Lobby Control

Getting third-partied from nowhere?
Slide in with the **PUBG Wallhack**—an elite overlay beaming skeletal ESP, loot glow, and 2-D radar while spoofing your HWID so BattlEye shrugs. A mid-May purge roasted roughly **210 000** cheaters, yet users of this injector walked away spotless.

## Overview

PUBG’s new *Fog of War* system hides data for out-of-sight players, neutering most wallhacks. Our overlay grabs **post-projection memory**—the frame that already passed the dev filter—so every rival glows bright red while the watchdog sees nothing. 
Signature randomization and throttled read/write calls mimic legit overlays, keeping heuristics calm even when sweeps tighten.

## Feature Breakdown 🛠️

* **X-Ray ESP** – full boxes, health bars, distance tags, out-of-view arrows. 🙂
* **Loot Glow** – color-coded rarity so you hoover best-in-slot gear.
* **Snap Radar** – draggable mini-map to monitor flankers on a second screen.
* **Stealth HWID Spoofer** – flips machine ID each boot—no tinkering needed.
* **Recoil-Nuke Script** – erase vertical kick for sky-beam sprays.

## Why Our Wallhack Obliterates the Competition 💥

If your rig plays PUBG—think i5-6600K + GTX 1060 & 16 GB RAM—you’re golden. The cheat sips < 5 % CPU and under 50 MB RAM even in Pochinki chaos.
